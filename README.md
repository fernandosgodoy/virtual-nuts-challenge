# Virtual Nuts - Challenge
Welcome to my application for the Virtual Nuts process.

Since now, thank you for your time to analyse for a moment for this code. 

I know, each one of us have a logic and sometimes makes no sense in a first and this is why I'll explain below some approaches used here.

One note, I imagine that the technical team will test this code, but I always make the steps to help all members of the team.

I always pay attention to documenting the things that I deliver. Who knows one day, if another developer needs to maintain my code, we are on the same page. :)

Well, let's start!

# How to setup the dev environment
First of all, we'll setup the local environment to test the scripts.

I used a Node based project and all results you can check in local console or terminal (depends on the operational system).

Let's start to setup the env:

### Install the Node
Download and install the NodeJs package here:

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Donwload Node</a>

### Install Jest
If you don't have Jest package installed, it's safe to make the installation before the next step.
In terminal, type the command:

`
npm install  -g jest
`

### Install the dependecies
Now, installa the other dependencies typing the command:

`
npm install
`

# Exercicies resolution comments

I'll try to explain what I've tryed to deliver and the solution.



## 1. Print whole number to the console.
